# 5-Things-to-Optimize-Your-WordPress-Website-for-Mobile-Users
The number of smartphone users accessing sites has increased significantly in the past several years, surpassing desktop users. Thus, Google’s new target is mobile phone users, and it won't just do if your website is not mobile responsive. <br>

A mobile-first design is an approach where the website being developed primarily focuses on the user experience for mobile users over desktop users. <br>

With extensive WordPress development services, you can seamlessly make a responsive mobile version of your site, ensuring that all of Google’s guidelines are correctly imposed. <br>

This article will help you understand how to build a mobile-friendly website to optimize and increase your mobile traffic. <br>

1.Use a responsive WordPress theme <br>

On a desktop, your website might appear fantastic. However, if you do not employ a responsive theme that can adapt to numerous screen sizes, you will lose a significant portion of mobile phone users and, as a result, revenue. <br>

A responsive WordPress theme will adjust to the screen resolution they are opened on. This helps maintain the legibility and aesthetics of the website. With WordPress services, you can have a mobile site with the same content, images, and information on any device screen. <br>

2.Use responsive plugins <br>

Plugins add features and functionalities to your WordPress site to improve your website. They do not add anything visually to the front-end as such. But sometimes, like a widget or CTA button, you must ensure that they scale well on all screen sizes. <br>

WordPress website development services perform a quality check of your site to ensure its scaling correctly and efficiently across screen sizes. As long you have a responsive theme and plugins that adjust well to varying screen sizes, your site will be in good shape for mobile use. <br>

3.Avoid adding pop-ups <br>

If you use email marketing for your business, you might have a variety of opt-ins on your website. Many email opt-in forms work perfectly fine on mobile devices if they scale properly and are easy to use. <br>
However, pop-ups are a different story altogether. Sites with intrusive opt-ins that cover the site's content are being penalized by Google. This includes pop-ups and other types of opt-ins that a user must dismiss before accessing the content on the page. <br>

4.Strategize for responsive media <br>

Whether a daily blog or an eCommerce site, an important aspect of making your site mobile responsive is considering the media on your site. If you have too many images on your site, it will take longer to load because of the large size of the images. If your images do not scale down correctly, it can lead to a difficult viewing experience on your phone. <br>

You can discuss this with your WordPress development services provider to find the best solution for your website. They will either suggest scaling the media to make it more responsive or hiding certain elements when your site is loaded on a smartphone. <br>

5.Improve your website loading time <br>

Page speed is an essential ranking factor in Google search results. Media is a big part of the performance equation, but the code and your WordPress host also play a significant role in the page speed. <br>

A good WordPress development service in India will use minimal code with only essential plugins to optimize your site's performance. <br>

As for the WordPress host, make sure you use a quality host with services like caching technology, CDN, and infrastructure powered by reliable providers. <br>

A Final Word <br>

Many people use their phones to browse websites in this increasingly mobile-dominated world. Hence, mobile-friendliness is a must-have feature for any website in today’s digital era. While developing your website, keep in mind the above factors that can influence a consumer’s mobile involvement. <br>

A mobile-friendly website will help move your site up on the search engine rank list and increase traffic to your website.  Your audience and the search engine both demand it from modern websites. For this reason, website owners must know the importance of making their WordPress website mobile-friendly. <br>
